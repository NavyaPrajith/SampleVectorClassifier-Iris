This project focuses on the application of a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** to classify iris species using the well-known Iris dataset. The dataset contains features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with labels indicating three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The primary objective is to develop a robust classification model using SVC that can accurately categorize iris flowers into their respective species. Support Vector Classifier is chosen for its effectiveness in handling classification tasks, especially in scenarios with complex decision boundaries.

By leveraging SVC and the Iris dataset, the project provides valuable insights into the capabilities of machine learning algorithms in solving classification tasks, with potential applications in various fields such as botany, agriculture, and ecological studies.
